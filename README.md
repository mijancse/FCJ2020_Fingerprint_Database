# FCJ2020_Fingerprint_Database

## FCJ2020 Fingerprint Database
FCJ2020 is a collection of fingerprint images created by the contribution of the students of the Computer Science and Engineering department in Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University, Bangladesh, in 2019-2020. All the fingerprint images were compiled and analyzed by the principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Md. Mijanur Rahman.
